## House Price Prediction Project 

### 1. Introduction 

How to determine home value has been a common problem for every household. Knowing how to calculate your homeâ€™s value with the help of online valuation tools and trained professionals better prepares you to buy, sell, refinance or even negotiate lower property taxes.

There are some methods that have been used to predict house price: online valuation tools including automated valuation model with a confidence score; comparative market analysis by local real estate agent; FHFA House Price Index Calculator by Federal Housing Financing Agency; and a professional appraiser to evaluate the market, the property and comparable properties. It is important for households to know your house value, which allows you to evaluate what you can afford, determine whether a listing is priced appropriately and decide how to price your own home.

The objective of this project is to utilize data visualization, feature selection and feature engineering, and machine learning models to predict house prices. Additionally, it is aimed to minimize the difference between predicted and actual rating (RMSE /MSE) The house price prediction dataset contains 79 explanatory variables describing the majority aspects of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, and 1460 observations in training data while the testing data consists of 1459 observations.

### 2. Hypotheses 

**Hypotheses: What variables are highly relevant to determine the sales price?** To be more specific, whether the following features including LotArea, Neighborhood, OverallQual, Full Bath, YearBuilt, TotalBsmtSF, CentralAir, GrLivArea, GarageArea, will be able to predict the outcome, the housing price.

### 3. Data Processing and Exploration (more information and graphs are in the final report) 
The training dataset has 1460 observations and 81 variables, and 1459 observations and 80 variables are in the test dataset. In order to get a better understanding and comprehensiveness of the dataset, I decided to first see the top 10 variables that have a high correlation with the SalePrice.

From analysis, we can see that there are 10 out of 38 variables with a positive correlation of at least 0.5 with SalePrice. It also shows the multicollinearity issue which we will discuss in the limitation part. If we think about these variables, we can conclude that they give almost the same information so we only need to choose one of them as key variables.

The scatter plot confirms my opinion.GrLivArea, TotalBsmtSF, TotRmsAbvGrd, and GarageArea are positively correlated with SalePrice, which means that as one variable increases, the other also increases. In the case of 'TotalBsmtSF', we can see that the slope of the linear relationship is particularly high, and it makes sense that big houses are generally more expensive.

One of the figures we may find interesting is the one between 'TotalBsmtSF' and 'GrLiveArea'. In this figure, we can see the dots drawing a linear line, which almost acts like a border. It totally makes sense that the majority of the dots stay below that line. Basement areas can be equal to the above-ground living area, but it is not expected a basement area bigger than the above-ground living area.

In addition, I take an extra look at OverallQual since it has the highest correlation rate with SalePrice.
