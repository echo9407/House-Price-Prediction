## House Price Prediction Project 

### 1. Introduction and background section

How to determine home value has been a common problem for every household. Knowing how to calculate your homeâ€™s value with the help of online valuation tools and trained professionals better prepares you to buy, sell, refinance or even negotiate lower property taxes.
There are some methods that have been used to predict house price: online valuation tools including automated valuation model with a confidence score; comparative market analysis by local real estate agent; FHFA House Price Index Calculator by Federal Housing Financing Agency; and a professional appraiser to evaluate the market, the property and comparable properties. It is important for households to know your house value, which allows you to evaluate what you can afford, determine whether a listing is priced appropriately and decide how to price your own home.
