House Price Prediction Project 

In this project, you will select a dataset, define a problem or prediction task that you will solve using the machine learning methods that you have learned in the course, and write up your results in a short report. The main goal of this project is for to demonstrate your ability to select and implement appropriate machine learning models for data, in order to answer an interesting question.
However, the project also emphasizes the importance of clearly defining your analysis objectives, thoroughly exploring and understanding the data you are working with, and consideration of potential broader implications (such as business, social, and ethical issues) of the analysis that you do. Finally, you must communicate your analyses in a succinct but rigorous format.
